# Connected-Components-Labeling
Implementations of connected component labeling algorithms for binary images. Currently, there are two algorithms implemented - 
recursive and union-find. Both of these implementations are based on the pseudocode described in Shapiro and Stockton's Computer Vision
 text. To ensure contiguous labels in the union-find implementation, there is one additional post-processing step.
 
 Some example outputs can be seen below.
 
 Note: I believe there are a few bugs in these implementations which need to be addressed - will need to revisit.
